## Description

This is a phase of a four phase project, to create a basic clone of the AirBnB web. In this first phase a basic console was created using the Cmd Python module, to manage the objects of the whole project, being able to implement the methods create, show, update, all, and destroy to the existing classes and subclasses.

## How to start it:
 Clone the repository of the project from Github. This will contain the simple shell program and all of its dependencies.

## How to use it:
It can work in two different modes:


**Interactive** and **Non-interactive**.

In **Interactive mode**, the console will display a prompt (hbnb) indicating that the user can interact with the prompt.

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```

In **Non-interactive mode** ((like the Shell project in C)), the shell will need to be run with a command input piped into its execution so that the command is run as soon as the Shell starts. In this mode no prompt will appear, and no further input will be expected from the user.


```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$

## examples:

*destroy**
  * Usage: `destroy <class> <id>` or `<class>.destroy(<id>)`

Deletes a class instance based on a given id. The storage file `file.json` 
is updated accordingly.

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) create State
d2d789cd-7427-4920-aaae-88cbcf8bffe2
(hbnb) create Place
3e-8329-4f47-9947-dca80c03d3ed
(hbnb)
(hbnb) destroy State d2d789cd-7427-4920-aaae-88cbcf8bffe2
(hbnb) Place.destroy(03486a3e-8329-4f47-9947-dca80c03d3ed)
(hbnb) quit
$ cat file.json ; echo ""
{}
```
